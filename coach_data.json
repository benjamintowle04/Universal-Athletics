            "about": "I am a junior dual sport student athlete at Simpson College majoring in Sports Administation and minoring in Coaching and Sports Communications. I am on the football and mens volleyball team. While growing up I played a handful of sports and was lucky enough to represent Eagan High School as a captain in Football and Basketball. I enjoy being active and being around my family and friends. I am ecstatic to be a part of Universial Athletics and look forward to seeing where our journey leads us.",
            "uaMeaning": "Sports have helped me understand how valuable and blessed we are to live and to be surrounded by life. From a young age it was instilled in me that you help others without having a reason to do so. I understand the power we have as humans and much more so as humans with influence. I want to spread positivity and build community. At UA I want our athletes to grow physically, emotionally, and mentally as we continue to take on this so-called “life” together. I live for community and positive change and am excited to build a team within Universal Athletics to spread this message and mission as far as the universe will take it!",
